Made for the july 2024 godot xr game jam (https://itch.io/jam/godot-xr-game-jam-july-2024).

Also see the "credits.md" file for other asset licenses and attributions.

If you want to edit or run it you will need to re-install some of the addons from the assetlib, I haven't included their binary dependies to avoid shoving too many blobs into git.
